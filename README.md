# Holographic Fractals
Holographic fractals for Voxon volumetric display

## Usage
### Controls:
* `+ / -` : Increase / decrease voxels resolution. Tune it according to the performance.
* `Enter` : Cycle fractals, shapes

## Building
MinGW compiler was used for this project, VSCode has two build tasks:
* `gcc.exe build active file - release`
* `gcc.exe build active file - debug`

Using MSVC should be straighforward, PR welcome :)
